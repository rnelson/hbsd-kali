After watching [SSSilverLink](https://www.twitch.tv/sssilverlink) go through a bunch of [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com) exercises, I decided that I wanted to get as many of those tools available on a BSD VM. I've also been wanting an excuse to try out [HardenedBSD](https://hardenedbsd.org), a security-focused fork of [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org), and figured this would be a good excuse to run it on a VM.
